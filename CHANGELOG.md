## Unreleased
### Added
- Parent directories for pathouts are created if necessary.
- It is possible to create nodes that run commands with `yape.cmd()` now.
- In cached mode, Yape also checks for existence of output paths now.

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Renamed parameter `graph` of `Node` constructor to `parent`.
    That way, we have both `Node` and `Graph` using the same parameter name
    for the graph containing them.
- **BREAKING**: Nodes and graphs have the global graph as parent by default
    now. `no_parent=True` must be used if it is desired for the object not to
    have a parent.
- **BREAKING**:
  - `Runner` (and consequently `yape.run()`) use the global graph by
    default now.
  - `MingraphBuilder` (and consequently `yape.mingraph()`) use the global
    graph by default now.
- **BREAKING**: default cache directory changed to `.yape/cache`.
- **BREAKING**: `Runner` (and consequently `yape.run()`) now use cached node
  state by default. In order to keep the behavior of `0.1.0` use
  `cached=False` when calling `yape.run()`.

### Fixed
- Output paths are now regenerated by running the node again in case their
  modification time is later than the last time the node ran. This fixes the
  case when a node is run with a set of dependencies, then again with a new
  set, and finally again (but this time skipped) with the first set of
  dependencies. Without this fix, the output path would contain be the file
  from the second run.

## 0.1.0 - 2021-10-14
### Added
- First release!
